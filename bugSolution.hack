```hack
function foo(x: int): int {
  return x + 1;
}

function bar(x: int): int {
  return foo(x) * 2;
}

function main(): void {
  var x: int = 5;
  var y: int = bar(x);
  echo y; // Outputs 12
}
```
**Solution:**
The solution is simple: ensure that the return type of `foo` function correctly matches its implementation.  If it's supposed to return an integer, make sure it doesn't return a string, and vice-versa.  Explicit type checking helps to prevent this type of unexpected behavior.  Thorough testing and comprehensive type hinting are crucial for avoiding such subtle errors in Hack.  Using a static analyzer can also help catch these issues earlier in the development process.
